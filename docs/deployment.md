# Deployment

This section covers best practices for deploying Health Check Monitor in production.

## Security Best Practices

Store sensitive information in environment variables rather than in the configuration file:

```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX"
export SMTP_USERNAME="username" 
export SMTP_PASSWORD="password"
export BASIC_AUTH="dXNlcjpwYXNz"  # Base64 of "user:pass"
```

Then reference them in your configuration:

```yaml
headers:
  Authorization: Basic ${BASIC_AUTH}
  X-API-Key: ${API_KEY}
```

## Resource Usage

Memory and CPU usage scale with the number of endpoints being monitored. To optimize resource usage:

- Adjust `concurrency_limit` based on your system capabilities
- Use longer intervals for non-critical services
- Set appropriate timeouts to prevent hangs
- Consider distributing monitoring across multiple instances for large deployments

## Persistent Storage

For long-term tracking of health check status:

- Mount a volume for logs if using Docker
- Consider setting up a centralized logging system
- Use a database for storing historical health data (if implemented)

## Redundancy

For critical monitoring, consider:

- Running multiple instances in different regions
- Using different notification channels for redundancy
- Setting up monitoring for the monitoring system itself

## Container Orchestration

Health Check Monitor works well with container orchestration platforms:

- Use Kubernetes for automatic scaling and failover
- Set resource limits to prevent excessive resource usage
- Use a service mesh for secure communication
- Use secrets management for storing sensitive information
